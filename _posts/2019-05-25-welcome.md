# Welcome!

Let me introduce myself, my name is Andrea Rossini, I am an enthusiast software developer, and after 17 years of career I thought it was time to share some knowledge. I will talk about .NET but not only, I want to share my journey on learning new technologies, and maybe write interesting articles about whatever old code I may find lying somewhere on my PC.

I also plan to load my CV sometime in the future, learn the features of GitHub pages, and make a nice looking website.

See you next time!
